#Author: Joel, Date:09/22/2026, Purpose: To perform T-Test

# Create variables x and y with some dummy dataset

x = rnorm(10)
y = rnorm(10)

# Make a normal distribution plot/curve for reference

pts = seq(-4.5,4.5,length=100)
plot(pts,dt(pts,df=9),col='red',type='l')

# Add x and y points on existing plot window

lines(density(x), col='green')
lines(density(y), col='blue')

# Add another curve, color Yellow with 100 points between
2 to 4

pts = seq(2,4,length=100)
lines(density(pts),col='yellow')

# Apply the T-test fucntion to check differences 
between variables x and y
ttest =t.test(x,y)


        Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  x and y
t = 0.08867, df = 15.579, p-value = 0.9305
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.8318807  0.9043428
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y 
0.2958386 0.2596075 

# x and y are not significantly different variables/groups
